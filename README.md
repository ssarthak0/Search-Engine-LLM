This Streamlit application allows users to interact with a chatbot powered by LangChain and Groq's LLMs. The chatbot can search the web using tools like Arxiv, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo to provide informed responses.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface**: Engage in a conversational UI powered by Streamlit's `st.chat_input` and `st.chat_message`.
- **Web Search Integration**: Utilize Arxiv, Wikipedia, and DuckDuckGo to fetch real-time information.
- **Streaming Responses**: Experience real-time streaming of responses using `StreamlitCallbackHandler`.
- **Customizable Settings**: Input your Groq API key securely via the sidebar.
